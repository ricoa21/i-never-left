      question: "What's included in the £499?",
      answer: "Everything in Pro plus a dedicated human account manager, monthly keep-warm posts while you are away, your full return campaign, and 3 full months of post-return support. It covers your entire break and your first 3 months back. After that, continue from £99 per month or walk away. No lock-in."
    },
    {
      question: "How long does £499 cover?",
      answer: "Your entire break — however long that is — plus 3 months after your return. The only cap is on keep-warm posts which max out at 12 months, same as Pro."
    },
    {
      question: "What does the dedicated account manager do?",
      answer: "Your account manager is a real person — not a bot, not an automated system. They know your name, your industry, your clients, and your comeback story. From day one they handle your campaign setup, approve content with you, manage your social scheduling, and are on hand throughout your break for any changes or questions. One human, full accountability."
    },
    {
      question: "What does the 3 months post-return support include?",
      answer: "Month 1: 2 posts per week, DMs monitored during return week, booking enquiries logged and followed up. Month 2: 1 post per week, one SMS nudge to anyone who hasn't rebooked, a check-in call with your account manager. Month 3: 1 post per week, full performance report, and a handover pack covering what worked and how to keep the momentum going yourself."
    },
    {
      question: "What happens during my return week?",
      answer: "Your full return campaign fires — email and SMS to your entire contact list. Daily content published all week. DMs monitored so nothing gets missed. It is the biggest moment of the whole campaign and we treat it that way."
    },
    {
      question: "How are messages sent?",
      answer: "Message 1 goes out by email or SMS before you leave — whichever suits you best. Message 2 goes out by SMS 4 weeks before your return, though this can also be sent by email if you prefer — just let us know when you sign up. Message 3 fires by both email and SMS on return day for maximum reach."
    },
    {
      question: "What are the optional add-ons?",
      answer: "Additional platforms — from £49 per month per platform for TikTok or LinkedIn. Premium content — need professional photography, video or animation? Through our friends at Company Content we can source the right creative talent. Custom quote."
    },
    {
      question: "What if I don't have social media?",
      answer: "We swap all social posts for additional email and SMS touchpoints instead. Same impact, different channels. Just let us know when you sign up."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I downgrade to Pro?",
      answer: "Yes — but only before your return campaign fires. Once your return week begins, the 3 month post-return support kicks in automatically and the full £499 applies. If you have not notified us before return day, the Concierge rate stands. Get in touch before that point and we will adjust without any fuss."
    },
    {
      question: "What if my return date changes?",
      answer: "No problem at all. Your account manager will reschedule everything around your new date. Nothing falls through the cracks."
    },
    {
      question: "What happens if some messages bounce?",
      answer: "We send everything from verified infrastructure to keep delivery rates high. If anything bounces we will let you know and you can swap in replacement contacts within 48 hours. Worth making sure your list is up to date before we kick off."
    },
    {
      question: "Is the £499 a one-off payment?",
      answer: "Yes — £499 is a one-off payment covering your entire break and 3 months back. After that, if you want to keep the momentum going, we can continue from £99 per month. No hidden fees, cancel anytime."
