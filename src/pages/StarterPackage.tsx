      question: "What do I need to provide?",
      answer: "Your contact list (up to 100 names, email addresses and/or phone numbers), a brief about your business and the service you offer, your preferred tone, and your booking link. That's it — we handle everything else."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I approve the messages before they go out?",
      answer: "Absolutely. We send you all three messages for sign-off before anything is scheduled. Nothing goes out without your say-so."
    },
    {
      question: "How long does setup take?",
      answer: "Once we receive your contact list and brief, we'll have your campaign ready within 48 hours. You approve, we schedule, done."
    },
    {
      question: "How are the messages sent?",
      answer: "The default sequence is Email → SMS → Email+SMS on return day, which is what we've found works best. If you'd prefer a different combination — say all email or all SMS — just let us know when you sign up and we'll tailor it for you."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I upgrade my plan?",
      answer: "Yes — and you can do it at any point before your return campaign fires. If you upgrade to Pro, you'll get one keep-warm Instagram post for every month remaining in your break. So if you've got 6 months left, that's 6 posts. Upgrade earlier = more posts, more value. Just get in touch and we'll sort it. The only thing we can't do is upgrade after your final return message has gone out."
    },
    {
      question: "What if my return date changes?",
      answer: "No problem at all. Just let us know and we'll reschedule the campaign around your new date. Dates shift — we're flexible."
    },
    {
      question: "How do the Instagram posts work?",
      answer: "We create both posts for you — designed, captioned, and ready to go. We'll send them straight to you to publish yourself. No password sharing, no third-party access — just you posting great content that we've made for you. Takes about 30 seconds on your end."
    },
    {
      question: "Is this a one-off payment or a subscription?",
      answer: "Starter is a one-off payment of £99. No monthly fees, no hidden costs, no surprises."
