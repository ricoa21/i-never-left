      question: "What do I need to provide?",
      answer: "Your contact list (up to 200 names, email addresses and/or phone numbers), a brief about your business, your preferred tone, and your booking link. That's it — we handle everything else."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I approve everything before it goes out?",
      answer: "Absolutely. Every message and every keep-warm post comes to you for sign-off first. Nothing is scheduled without your approval."
    },
    {
      question: "How do the monthly keep-warm posts work?",
      answer: "Once you sign up we create all your keep-warm posts in one go — you approve them once and we auto-schedule them monthly via Buffer. One post per month, up to 12 months maximum. You connect your Instagram to Buffer once, we load everything in, and it fires automatically. You can see every scheduled post and revoke access anytime."
    },
    {
      question: "How are the return week posts handled?",
      answer: "On your return week we publish 4 posts across 7 days — an announcement on day 1, behind the scenes on day 3, a booking reminder on day 5, and a wrap-up on day 7. All created by us, scheduled via Buffer, designed to keep you visible all week not just for one day."
    },
    {
      question: "How are the messages sent?",
      answer: "Message 1 goes out by email or SMS — whichever suits you best. Message 2 goes out by SMS about 4 weeks before your return. Message 3 fires by both email and SMS on return day for maximum reach. If you'd prefer a different combination just let us know when you sign up."
    },
    {
      question: "What if I don't have social media?",
      answer: "No problem. We swap all social posts — both the monthly keep-warm posts and the return week content — for additional email and SMS touchpoints instead. Same impact, different channels. Just let us know when you sign up."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I upgrade to Concierge?",
      answer: "Yes — at any point before your return campaign fires. Just get in touch and we'll work out a custom quote based on what you need. The difference will be charged at the Concierge rate."
    },
    {
      question: "What if my return date changes?",
      answer: "No problem. We'll reschedule your entire campaign and keep-warm schedule around your new date. Your Buffer queue updates too."
    },
    {
      question: "What does the post-return support include?",
      answer: "For 30 days after your return we track engagement across your campaign — who opened, clicked, and replied. At the two week mark we send one SMS nudge to anyone who hasn't responded yet. After that the campaign is complete and you're back in business. Need more ongoing support? That's what Concierge is for."
    },
    {
      question: "What happens if some messages bounce or don't deliver?",
      answer: "We send everything from verified, trusted infrastructure to keep delivery rates high. If any emails or SMS messages bounce we'll let you know straight away. You can swap in a replacement contact within 48 hours and we'll resend. We can't guarantee delivery to contacts with outdated details — so it's worth checking your list is up to date before we start."
    },
    {
      question: "Is Pro a one-off payment?",
      answer: "The £249 covers your full campaign, all keep-warm posts, your return week content, and 30 days of post-return support. No hidden fees."
