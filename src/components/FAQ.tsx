      question: "How is my data protected?",
      answer: "All information is encrypted and only accessed by your dedicated campaign manager. We use industry-standard security protocols. Your contact list data is permanently deleted within 30 days of your campaign completing. We never share or sell your information to third parties."
    },
    {
      icon: Trash2,
      question: "What if I want my data deleted?",
      answer: "You can request data deletion at any time during or after your campaign. Simply contact us at hello@ineverleft.co.uk and your information will be permanently removed from our systems. We provide written confirmation once deletion is complete."
    },
    {
      icon: Lock,
      question: "Do I need to share my passwords?",
      answer: "Absolutely not. All integrations use secure OAuth authentication or API tokens. You maintain full control of your accounts at all times. We never ask for, store, or access your passwords."
    },
    {
      icon: HelpCircle,
      question: "What happens after I sign up?",
      answer: "After signup, you'll complete a quick intake form about your business and clients. Within 24 hours, we'll be in touch to arrange a brief consultation call. We then build your campaign, you approve everything, and we handle the rest."
    },
    {
      icon: FileText,
      question: "Are you GDPR compliant?",
      answer: "Yes, fully. We only process data necessary for your campaign, maintain transparent data handling practices, and ensure your rights to access, rectify, and erase your data at any time. All our practices align with UK GDPR and the Data Protection Act 2018. We are registered with the ICO."
    },
    {
      icon: Shield,
      question: "How do you handle client contact lists?",
      answer: "Your uploaded contact list is used solely to deliver your campaign — nothing else. We act as a data processor on your behalf. All contact data is permanently deleted within 30 days of your campaign completing. By uploading a list, you confirm you have the necessary consent to contact those individuals."
